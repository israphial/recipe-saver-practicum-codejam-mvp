# Sample App for Practicum Hackathon - Recipe Saver

## Desc

This app will be a recipe storage application, that will allow a user to add new recipes and descriptions to a "notebook" containing all previous recipes.
The recipes storage will be contained in localstorage and retrieved on page load.

A plus button will be on the page somewhere to add a recipe, which will open a popup that lets the user give a title, picture, description, and author for making the recipe.
After submitting, that recipe will be added to the recipes data list and will appear in the sidebar with the rest of the recipes.
Recipes will be delete-able.
